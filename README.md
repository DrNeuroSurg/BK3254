# IMPORTANT NOTE

take care what module you buy, where are version which did not have support for all features,read description of what you buy, for example here from aliexpress:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomaskovacik/BK3254/master/bk3254_only_BT.png">

<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-pcs-BK3254-Bluetooth-Module-4-1-F6888-Stereo-Audio-Module-FM-Radio-TF-Card-U/32833631256.html">This module at aliexpress</a> works with my breadboard adapter, at least one I buy few months back.

<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BK3254-Bluetooth-4-1-stereo-audio-module-support-FM-radio-TF-card-U-disk-infrared-remote/32811949610.html">This one</a> has only BT and AUX funtionality, it make poping noise, then module is switching between internaly generated sounds and BT or while swtching from BT to AUX, probably need to use mute pin for muting poweramp, buttons areon ADC, in this PDF:  https://github.com/tomaskovacik/kicad-library/blob/master/library/datasheet/F-6888_bk3254/F-6888_BK3254_datasheet.pdf. I need to state that module which I receive hase these markings: F-6888, V1.2 2016-8-6, so this is not indication of anything!, shame :(

Here is wiki page with some modules I tested from ali: https://github.com/tomaskovacik/BK3254/wiki/modules-from-ali

# How to install

Follow this link to arduino.cc: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5

# how to connect BK3254

## directly to computer

this is for testing if your module has serial interface enabled:

BK3254|computer(USB2serial for example)
-------|-------
   RX  |  TX
   TX  |  RX
  GND  |  GND
 VBAT  |  via diode to 5V

## arduino using software serial (UNO, nano..)

BK3254|computer(USB2serial for example)
-------|-------
   RX  |  7 (1st parameter of SoftwareSerial in example)
   TX  |  6 (2nd parameter of SoftwareSerial in example)
 RESET |  5 (defined as resetBTpin in example)
  GND  |  GND
 VBAT  |  via diode to 5V


## arduino using harware serial (mega ..)

BK3254|computer(USB2serial for example)
-------|-------
   RX  |  TX1 (if using Serial1)
   TX  |  RX1 (if using Serial1)
 RESET |  5 (defined as resetBTpin in example)
  GND  |  GND
 VBAT  |  via diode to 5V
